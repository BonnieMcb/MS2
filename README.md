# British Wildlife Memory Game

## Code Institute Milestone Project 2

This website is created for educational purposes only.

//![Happy Dogs Responsive](/assets/images/responsivedog.png)    
    
The brief for this second Milestone project was to make a responsive and dynamic website using HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript. It is the second of four projects as part of the Full Stack Web Development Program at The Code Institute. 
The British Wildlife Memory Game (BWMG) was created first and foremost as a way to fulfil the requirements of this brief. As I already made a website for the first project, I wanted to make a game in order to use a lot of JavaScript. Thus, a pairs matching game seemed like a good option. I previously worked as an Ecologist in the UK, and ecology and conservation still hold a great interest to me. I therefore decided to put my own spin on the pairs matching game by making it an educational game where users can learn more about British wildlife.

## UX (User Experience)

### Goals

#### Basic Goals
In terms of the BWMG, the goal was to:
 - Create a fully-functioning memory game.
 - 

#### Stretch Goals
With time and resources allowing, the goal was to:
- Allow the user to select between 'Learning mode' and 'Timed mode'.
- Choose a difficulty setting where the higher difficulty increases the number of tiles.
- Choose between three categories of pictures to match.

### User Stories

1. As a potential customer, I want to see services on offer and get a feel for the company.
2. As a potential customer who has had a bad experience at a competitor, I want to know who the groomers are and if they are reliable.
3. As a potential user, I browse websites on my mobile phone and want to have a good experience and be able to find and view the information I want.
4. As a potential user I want to know if the business is easy to get to.
5. As a potential customer I want to know what other people say about this business.
6. As a returning customer I want to be reminded of the services available and be able to make a booking easily.
